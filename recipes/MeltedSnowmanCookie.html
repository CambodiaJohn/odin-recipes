    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This adorable sugar cookie is super easy and the kids love it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>  ¾ cup butter, softened  </li>
        <li>  ¾ cup white sugar  </li>
        <li>  1 teaspoon baking powder  </li>
        <li>  ¼ teaspoon salt  </li>
        <li>  1 egg  </li>
        <li>  1 tablespoon milk  </li>
        <li>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  </li>
        <li> 2 cups all-purpose flour  </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat white sugar, baking powder, and salt into butter until just combined. Beat egg, milk, and vanilla extract into butter-sugar mixture; add flour and mix until dough is just combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until dough is slightly chilled, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Scoop dough into balls slightly larger than golf balls; flatten into cookies. Arrange cookies on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 10 to 20 minutes. Cool on baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely, at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Butter a microwave-safe plate. Place marshmallows on the prepared plate.</li>
        <li>Microwave marshmallows until slightly puffed, 10 to 15 seconds. Gently press marshmallows until bottoms slightly ooze.</li>
        <li>Whisk confectioners' sugar and water together in a bowl until icing is slightly thicker than drizzle-consistency. Pour icing over cookies so it runs over the edges, reserving about 1 tablespoon.</li>
        <li>Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl, about 30 seconds. Pour melted chocolate into a piping bag with a small tip or a plastic bag with a corner snipped.</li>
        <li>Press 1 marshmallow close to an edge of each cookie to be the snowman's head. Draw 'stick arms' onto the icing using the melted chocolate.</li>
        <li>Divide the reserved 1 tablespoon icing into 2 small bowls. Mix red food coloring into 1 of the bowls and orange food coloring into the other bowl. Decorate the snowmen with scarves or ties using the red icing and yellow icing.</li>
    </ol>
